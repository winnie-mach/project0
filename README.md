#Project 0 Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game that runs from your browser. This is my first project individual project.  

## Installation
Simply open up the game in your browser. Use Google Chrome for the best experience. Open up the game from [here:](https://winnie-mach.github.io/project0/)

## Instructions for Play
This is a two player game, each person takes turns clicking on a square, the first player is X and the second player is O. The player who manages to get 3 symbols in a row wins, if all boxes are filled and no one gets 3 symbols in a row then the game is a draw.
